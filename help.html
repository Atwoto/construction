Critical Issues Found:
1. API Response Structure Mismatch
Your service files expect the API to return data in response.data.data format, but your standalone serverless functions (/api/projects/stats.js and /api/clients/stats.js) are returning data directly with res.status(200).send(data[0] || {}).
Problem:

Services expect: response.data.data
API returns: response.data (directly)

2. Vercel Routing Configuration Issue
Your vercel.json has ALL API routes going to /api/index.js (the Express server), but you want the stats endpoints to use the faster standalone functions.
Problem: The rewrites rule "/api/(.*)": "/api/index.js" catches /api/projects/stats and routes it to Express instead of your optimized /api/projects/stats.js function.
3. Missing CORS Headers in Standalone Functions
Your standalone functions don't set CORS headers, which could cause browser requests to fail.
4. Database Connection in Express Server
Your Express server calls initializeModels() which may be causing the 25-second timeout when the full Express app loads.
Tell Your Agent To:

Fix the Vercel routing - Update vercel.json to route stats endpoints to standalone functions BEFORE the catch-all Express route
Fix API response format - Either make standalone functions return {data: result} OR update services to expect direct response
Add CORS headers - Add proper CORS headers to standalone functions
Check database initialization - The initializeModels() call in Express server might be hanging
